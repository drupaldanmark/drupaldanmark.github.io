  <h2>29. May 2015 @ Kulturhuset Indre By</h2>

  <p>Arranged for your pleasure for the <em>8th</em> time by Drupal Denmark</p>

<section id="introduction">
  <h3>We are working hard on getting a solid line up of speakers for Drupalhagen, how ever we are still looking for more to speak!</h3>
</section>

<section id="mission">
  <h3>Camp mission!</h3>

  <p>Following along with the guidelines of Drupal Denmark, our main focus is to spread and share knowledge of Drupal to
    all types of users, however we are mainly represented by developers –Frontend, Backend and what have you of types–
    and so the majority of the content will be focused around that segment of users.</p>

  <p>That said we are very open to new ideas and suggestions about what topics or talks we should include at the camp, let us hear about in!</p>

  <p>We will try to keep talks within 2 different focus topics: <em>Drupal 8</em> & <em>Drupal 7</em></p>

  <h4>Drupal 8</h4>

  <p>What improvements and new technologies are Drupal 8 gonna bring and how can we already now begin to take advantage off!</p>

  <h4>Drupal 7</h4>

  <p>Is still widely used and will most likely be so for the near future, but how are we gonna prepare our self and take advantage of elements already implemented in Drupal 8</p>
